;; chain.core — parent-linked, content-addressed commit chain.
;;
;; Renamed from `commit-dag` (ADR-2607050800): "chain" names what this
;; actually is -- a parent-linked chain of commits -- and lines up cleanly
;; with this namespace's own `chain`/`verify-chain`/`head` functions, without
;; the collision `log` would have had with the unrelated, already-existing
;; `kotoba-lang/log` (structured logging/telemetry, `kotoba.lang.log`).
;; Deliberately decoupled from any particular index structure: a commit
;; wraps an opaque, dag-cbor-encodable `state` value -- today that's
;; typically a single `kotoba-lang/prolly-tree` root CID string, or
;; `kotoba-lang/arrangement`'s 4-index roots as a map of
;; `{"eavt" cid "aevt" cid ...}` -- this namespace never looks inside
;; `state`, it only chains and verifies it. See ADR-2607022600 (Wave 1/2).
;;
;; Storage is injected the same way `prolly-tree.core` does it: `put!` (cid,
;; bytes -> ignored) and `get-fn` (cid -> bytes), so a caller building on both
;; libraries shares one block store without any adapter glue.

;; every commit CID changed (clean break, pre-production, see superproject ADR).
;; `state` stays opaque: a plain value passes through untouched, and a caller
;; that wants its state's references walkable simply puts `ipld/link` values
;; inside it (kotobase-peer links its arrangement snapshot CID this way).
;; ── the causal fields, and why they are optional ────────────────────────────
;;
;; Root ADR-2608160200 asks a commit to carry WHY it was allowed and WHAT it
;; was caused by, and to stop being a single line: a per-principal signed
;; causal DAG rather than one chain.
;;
;; Every added field is written ONLY when supplied, so a commit made the way
;; commits were made before this encodes to the same bytes and keeps the same
;; CID. That is not politeness -- a format change here would rewrite the
;; identity of every commit that exists, and there is a test pinning two
;; known CIDs so the claim is checked rather than asserted.
;;
;;   "causes"    additional PARENTS: cross-principal causality. `prev` stays
;;               this principal's own sequence, so a chain is the special
;;               case of a DAG with one parent.
;;   "authority" the capability or receipt CID that permitted this write.
;;               Without it an audit reaches "who wrote this" and stops
;;               short of "why were they allowed to".
;;   "actor"     the principal whose sequence `prev` belongs to.
;;   "lamport"   1 + max over parents. Derived, never taken from the caller,
;;               so it cannot disagree with the edges it summarises.
;;
;; What this namespace does NOT do is check a signature. `authority` is a CID
;; it stores and verifies the SHAPE of; deciding that a grant was validly
;; issued belongs to aiueos, and a chain that pretended to do it would be
;; trusted for something it never checked.
