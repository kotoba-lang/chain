  "The cross-cutting test superproject ADR-2608170400 P5-1 asks for: causal DAG
  merge, actor authority, revocation, and the receipt parent chain, checked
  together rather than each in its own repo.

  They were each fine alone, which is why nothing caught the join: `chain`
  records `authority` and `actor` and says in a comment that it does not check
  them, and the grant shape with `revoked?`/`expires-at` lives in a different
  organisation's repository. A commit could name an authority that was revoked
  before it was written and every check in the stack passed."
